
# Use case
voice prompts allow for a hands free expirance, allowing for fast interaction without the need to take our eyes and hands from what you need to do.


# about
Simple plug in that leverages Android api for increased capability and accesability using voice prompts 

# future plans
Evenuitally I would like more voice interaction, as in this plug in would read the chats that come in, and you can talk and the plugin would turn it to text.
