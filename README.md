## Use case
voice prompts allow for a hands free expiration, allowing for fast interaction without the need to take our eyes and hands from what you need to do.

## Work in progress 
This started as a wouldnâ€™t it be nice to have a voice to say whats in the chat, or where the next navpoint is (this maybe a feature that i don't know how to turn on..) so I made (tried to) make a module to do it for me.
All so make note that no SDK files are included on purpose to make the project small

Leveraging Androids APIs to enable features such as tts (text-to-speach)
